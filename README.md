A simple exercise to retrieve the Italian Fiscal Code in python3.x. 
The program still lacks a GUI, so if you want to use it just open a Terminal window and type
```
python3 main.py
```
I still need to raise exceptions to control the inputs, but the fiscal code is caluclated correctly.
For now, the code only works if the first name and last name are only one-worders. I will later implement the case of double-name.
